**Joining the group as a postdoc**

I currently do not have *open positions*, but I do have funding for one postdoctoral fellow, with a tentative start date between May 2024 and August 2024. An ideal candidate would have a PhD degree in Statistics, Biostatistics, Computer Science, or a closely related area, with a demonstrated capacity to conduct high-quality research. If you are interested, please send me your CV and names of 3 references. 

​**Joining the group as a PhD student**


There is currently no open position available, as of May 2024. Open positions for the next year will be announced here in August 2024. Prospective PhD students must apply directly to the graduate program by November and indicate me as a preferred supervisor. If you are interested in working with me, please attach (i) your CV, (ii) academic records (i.e. unofficial transcripts), and (iii) a brief statement describing your research interest.

*Note for prospective PhD students in Psychology*

Please note that my current research program requires more training in quantitative fields (Statistics/Mathematics/CS) than what we usually expect from prospective PhD students in Psychology. It is recommended to read over my previous research before contacting me.

​**Joining the group as a master's or undergraduate student**

Depending on project availabilities, I might have openings for paid research assistants. I currently do not consider unpaid volunteers, but please contact me if you're interested in a reading course.
