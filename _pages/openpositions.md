**Postdoc**

I have one postdoctoral position available for developing statistical methods in neuroimaging or genetics/genomics. It is usually supported by University of Toronto [link1](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/awards/arts-science-postdoctoral-fellowship-program/), [link2](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/awards/provosts-postdoctoral-fellowship-program/), [link3](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/data-sciences-institute-postdoctoral-fellowships/)), CANSSI Ontario ([link1](https://canssiontario.utoronto.ca/canssi-ontario-postdoctoral-fellowship-in-theoretical-statistics/), [link2](https://canssiontario.utoronto.ca/ontario-genomics-canssi-ontario-pdf/)), or Banting ([link](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html)), where candidates must apply directly for the support.

Interested candidates are encouraged to contact me with project availabilities. Please attach your CV. A PhD degree in Statistics/Biostatistics/Quantitative Psychology/Computational Neuroscience is an ideal background, but I'm open to other qualifications.

â€‹**PhD student**

I have Ph.D. student openings in Statistical Sciences and Psychology at the University of Toronto. All admitted students are financially fully supported during the program. Applicants must apply directly to the graduate program by November, and indicate me as a preferred supervisor.

Interested applicants are welcome to contact me with research interests. Please attach your CV. Applicants with strong quantitative backgrounds and strong interests in making scientific contributions are particularly encouraged to apply. A master's degree is not a requirement for the Ph.D program.

**Opportunities for current undergraduate students at University of Toronto**

Depending on project availabilities, I might have openings for undergraduate researchers/research assistants. They are usually supported by NSERC ([link](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp)), University of Toronto ([link1](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/suds/), [link2](https://www.enrolment.utoronto.ca/2022-university-of-toronto-excellence-award-utea/)), and Department of Statistical Sciences ([link](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/current-students/research-opportunities-scholarships-awards)). I currently do not consider unpaid volunteers, but please contact me if you're interested in a reading course.
