**Joining the group as a postdoc**

I currently do not have open positions, but it changes on a rotating basis. If you are interested, please send me your CV and names of 3 references. 

​**Joining the group as a PhD student**

I have up to two Statistics PhD openings in the 2023-2024 admission cycle, where both domestic and international applicants are eligible. Prospective students must apply directly to the graduate program by November and indicate me as a preferred supervisor. If you are interested in working with me, please attach (i) your CV, (ii) academic records (i.e. unofficial transcripts), and (iii) a brief statement describing your research interest. 

*What I look for*

- My research philosophy is summarized by a popular phrase: *cool head and warm heart*, meaning that I seek to develop solid statistical methods that would lead to scientific advances. Applicants with strong quantitative backgrounds and interests in making scientific contributions are encouraged to apply. 

- Solid background in calculus is a must (like most other statistics PhD programs). I also expect that you have taken (calculus-based) probability and statistical inference.

- Courses in proof-based linear algebra and real analysis will be considered very favorably.

- Background in programming (e.g. coursework in CS), although not required, will be very beneficial.

- Prior research experience is not needed. However, it will be valuable for evaluating yourself whether you fit my research philosophy.

*Note for prospective PhD students in Psychology*

Please note that my current research program requires more training in quantitative fields (Statistics/Mathematics/CS) than what we usually expect from prospective PhD students in Psychology. It is recommended to read over my previous research before contacting me.

​**Joining the group as a master's or undergraduate student**

Depending on project availabilities, I might have openings for paid research assistants. I currently do not consider unpaid volunteers, but please contact me if you're interested in a reading course. In Fall 2023, I don't have any plans to supervise reading courses.
