**Joining the group as a postdoc**

I currently do not have *open positions* for postdoc positions, and openings would be available in November 2024.

​**Joining the group as a PhD student**

There are two PhD openings for 2025. Prospective PhD students must apply directly to the graduate program by November 2024 and indicate me as one of preferred supervisors. It is expected that applicants completed core statistics courses in probablity, math statistics, and applied statistics at minimum, and strong math *or* programming skills would be ideal. 

If you have any inquiries, feel free to reach out to me by sending an email with the title "**Prospective student**" and  your CV and unofficial transcript attached. 

*Note for prospective PhD students in Psychology*

Please note that my current research program requires more training in quantitative fields (Statistics/Mathematics/CS) than what we usually expect from prospective PhD students in Psychology. It is recommended to read over my previous research before contacting me.

​**Joining the group as a master's or undergraduate student**

Depending on project availabilities, I might have openings for paid research assistants. I currently do not consider unpaid volunteers, but please contact me if you're interested in a reading course.
