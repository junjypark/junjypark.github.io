I am an assistant professor at the University of Toronto, Department of Statistical Sciences and Department of Psychology. I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota in 2020 and B.A. in Mathematics/Statistics at Carleton College in 2012. 

I develop statistical methods for neuroimaging and genetic data. Especially, my research focus is developing statistical modeling and inference procedures to account for several layers of correlation structures, including spatial, temporal, and functional dependencies. 

My [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/junjypark/junjypark.github.io/blob/master/assets/pdf/JunYoung_Park(CurriculumVitae).pdf) is available in the link. My research is being supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the University of Toronto's Data Science Institute and McLaughlin Centre.
