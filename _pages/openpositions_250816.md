**Joining the group as a postdoc**

One postdoctoral fellowship opportunity is available through the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://schmidtfellows.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. Through this 2-year fellowship, the postdoctoral fellow will develop novel statistical methods for longitudinal neuroimaging data with applications in genetics and health records data. An ideal candidate is expected to have a PhD (or equivalent) in Statistics, Biostatistics, Quantitative Psychology, Computational Neuroscience, Bioinformatics, or related field by 2026. The application deadline is **October 8, 2025**, and those who are interested in should reach out to Dr. Jun Young Park by the end of August. 

​**Joining the group as a PhD student**

Our group is seeking up to two highly motivated PhD students in statistics to join in Fall 2026. These positions are open to both domestic and international applicants. An ideal candidate will have a strong background in mathematics and statistics, and a solid foundation in programming is highly recommended. We also value independence in research, which is often demonstrated through project or research experience, though prior research experience is not required. A master’s degree is not required for admission to the PhD program.

The application deadline is typically by the end of November, and all application materials should be submitted directly to the graduate admissions office. If you are interested in joining our group, please mention my name in your research statement. You can also contact me by email, provided that you attach your CV *and* transcript(s), and a brief description of your research interest.

*Notes for prospective PhD students in Psychology* Research in our group is generally highly quantitative, comparable to (or exceeding) the expectations for a quantitative psychology PhD. While I will be reviewing PhD applications this year, including those for co-supervision, I expect applicants to have solid training in quantitative methods.

​**Joining the group as a master's or undergraduate student**

For the 2025–26 academic year, I do not have openings for research assistants. I might have limited availability for a reading course, and interested students should contact me by **August 15** with a short statement of interest, CV, and transcripts.
