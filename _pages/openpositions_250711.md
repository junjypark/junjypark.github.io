**Joining the group as a postdoc**

One postdoctoral fellowship opportunity is available through the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://schmidtfellows.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. Through this 2-year fellowship, the postdoctoral fellow will develop novel statistical methods for longitudinal neuroimaging data with applications in genetics and health records data. An ideal candidate is expected to have a PhD (or equivalent) in Statistics, Biostatistics, Quantitative Psychology, Computational Neuroscience, Bioinformatics, or related field by 2026. The application deadline is **October 8, 2025**, and those who are interested in should reach out to Dr. Jun Young Park by the end of August. 

​**Joining the group as a PhD student**

More information will be available in August 2025.

​**Joining the group as a master's or undergraduate student**

For the 2025–26 academic year, I do not have openings for research assistants. I might have limited availability for a reading course, and interested students should contact me by **August 15** with a short statement of interest, CV, and transcripts.
