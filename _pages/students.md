After studying Statistics at the Pennsylvania State University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, I joined the Statistical Genetics team at Ambry Genetics, a commercial genetic testing lab. There, I gained hands-on experience with real-world clinical and genetics data. To further build my expertise in Statistical Genetics and Biostatistics, I am drawn to learn more, striving to work with my supervisors, Prof. Park and [Prof. Gronsbell](https://sites.google.com/view/jgronsbell/home?authuser=0), at the forefront of discovery and implementation in ways only available in academia.

*Achievements*
